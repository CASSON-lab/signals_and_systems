This repository contains files made avaiable as part of teaching the course "Signals and Systems" EEEN20027 for the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Manchester, UK.

All files were created in Matlab 2016a. They do not work correctly when run in earlier versions of Matlab. To run correctly the Control Systems toolbox is also required.
